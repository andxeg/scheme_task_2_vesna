As a young man, having just discovered the world of psychoanalysis, it occurred to me that the study of very severe psychological disturbances might lead to an understanding of the foundational constituents of human nature. Nothing could be more interesting, I thought, than to search for a new and deeper knowledge of the human condition as a psychotherapist. I have had the good fortune to pursue this quest for half a century.
One may ask the question, What really is madness? Here is how I would sum it up. Madness is not an illness or disease, it is not a condition existing somehow inside a person, and it is not a thing of any kind having objective existence. Madness is an experience a person may have, one involving in its essential core a fall into non being. Madness is the dissolution of all order and a descent into chaos. It is the greatest catastrophe of subjectivity that can happen to a person. The felt reality of the world disintegrates and the enduring solidity and integrity of one the ongoing experience of the terror of madness sanity and into the nothingness. This is the terror of madness, and it affects all those who come into its vicinity.
How can we, as explorers of the human soul, enter this dark territory? I think we need a map of that chaos, a picture of the variations we will encounter, and some general guidelines as to how we might respond to the disastrous human situations that are encountered. Also needed are protections from how we are ourselves perceived. A terrible toll may be taken on the clinician who may be viewed as a persecutor, as a god, or even as a persecuting god. An even greater injury may be inflicted on the patient, someone already in terrible trouble who now faces being seen as insane.
